# Slide 1

Committee members, colleagues, friends and family,

I would like to thank you all for attending my presentation here today. The
title of my thesis is "Beyond the average treatment effect: Risk-based
approaches to medical decision making".

\newpage

# Slide 2

Since we are looking at "risk-based" approaches it is important that I start
this talk from the notion of risk and its prediction.

The notion of prediction is present in everyone's life, especially whenever a
decision has to be made. "Should I go for spicy food for dinner tonight?" or
"should I "

One decision I face every day is: "What time should I leave home for work?". To
make this decsion I need to predict: "How much time will it take me to drive to
work"? This depends on many factors. For example, what day is it? Is it Tuesday
or Thursday? What time is it? Is it rush hour? What's the weather like? Is it
raining? Probably it's raining.

\newpage

# Slide 3

Now, decisions in healthcare are also very important. A question that is very
often asked is: "for a specific patient, how likely is it that they experience
an outcome of interest"?

For example, for a patient with hypertension, how likely is that they experience
an acute myocardial infarction? Or, for a patient with covid-19, how likely is
it that they are admitted to the intensive care unit?

In this case, as making the right decision is crucial and the consequences of a
wrong decision can be severe, we need to use a more elaborate approach for our
predictions. This often quite complex process is called prediction modeling and
its aim is to develop a rule that relates the outcome we are trying to avoid to
patient characteristics.

For example, in the case of covid-19 we would need to gather all the patients
who present at the emergency room with a covid-19 diagnosis and record all their
measurements: age, body temperature etc. Then we would follow them for a certain
period, say a month, and record if during this time they were admitted to the
intensive care unit. Finally, we would use some method to relate characteristics
like age and body temperature to a patient's likelihood of ending up in the
ICU. As, you can imagine we would expect older patients or patients with higher
body temperature to end up in the ICU more often.

\newpage

# Slide 4

And this is similar to what we did in chapter 6 of my thesis. We developed a
model for the prediction of patient's likelihood of dying or ending up in the
ICU within a month from being admitted to hospital with confirmed covid-19. We
also developed an online calculator to be used by clinicians that looked like
the one in this picture, where the doctors could input some of the patient's
measurements at the time of admission and it would return their probabilities of
dying or needing intensive care treatment.

\newpage

# Slide 5

Now, all this is definitely helpful if you want to know which patient you should
be paying closer attention to. However, a physician, needs to be able to propose
a course of treatment for the patient sitting in front them. So very often, the
question a doctor has to ask is: "For a specific patient, is treatment A better
or treatment B"?

So, it would be great if we could develop a model to answer this exact
question. For example, for a male 70-year old patient with hypertension
treatment A would be better for him. However, the reverse would be the case for
a female younger patient.

However, when we attempt to develop this model the same way we have presented so
far, we run into a problem. In the case of covid-19 and admission to the ICU, we
know for every patient in our data whether they actually ended up in the ICU or
not. That is not the case when we are comparing treatments.

\newpage

# Slide 6

We can never observe what would have happened, had the patient received the
alternative treatment. The moment the patient receives treatment A, it is
impossible for us to observe their outcome with treatment B. Therefore, we
cannot know if the the decision to give the patient treatment A was the correct
one.

But what would then be the appropriate approach for predicting the patient's
benefit?

\newpage

# Slide 7

Let's follow a thought process starting from science fiction and ending to what
is really done in practice. Let's say we wanted to define a model for the
prediction of benefit of treatment A compared to treatment B using the data from
a sample of people that we can recruit for our study.

Ideally, in order to observe the patient's response to both treatments we would
first need to give them treatment A, follow them for a specific amount of time
and record what happened to them. Then, put them in a time machine, send them
back in time to the moment of the decision, but now give them treatment
B. Follow them up for the same amount of time and record their response. At this
point we have the outcomes for both treatment decisions and we can say with
certainty that treatment A or B was better for this patient. Then, we do the
same thing for all the patients in our sample and now our data is complete. We
can finally build a model that relates the observed responses of our patients to
their characteristics. And then, we can use this model on any new patient that
we come across to decide whether to give them treatment A or treatment B. Even
though, I don't know how useful such a model would be, given that you have a
time machine available, anyway.

Since time travel is not an option, we could say that next best thing would be
to clone the patient, give each person a different treatment, follow them up for
a period of time, and then see which version of the patient did better.

Even though, this is not permitted, there have been studies that used twin
siblings for this kind of question. Of course they are very limited, as you can
imagine.

Finally, the next best thing, is to see what happened to patients similar to the
patient in question. This is the idea in clinical trials, where patients are
randomly given treatment A or treatment B, with the hope that if we do this for
a large enough number of people, then patients receiving treatment A will be on
average similar to patients receiving treatment B. For example, the average age
will be similar between two groups, the percentage of female patients will be
also similar, and so on. Then you can compare what happened on average to all
the people receiving treatment A, see what happened on average to patients
receiving treatment B and decide that, on average, say treatment A is better.

But, what about the original patient for whom we needed to make the decision?
One approach would be to say, that since on average treatment A is better, give
the patient treatment A. But can we expect that these treatments work the same
for all people? Should we maybe expect that for some people, treatment B might
work better or maybe it works the same as treatment A?

That is actually often anticipated and we often use the term treatment effect
heterogeneity to describe this non-random variability of treatment effects
across the population we are studying. That's why even when researchers design
clinical trials, they take into account that they should look into more specific
groups of people. For example, in addition to the average effect, they also
compare the treatment effects between males and females. Or older and younger
patients.

But how do you come up with these groups? When you decide to compare the two
treatments in male and female patients, you silently assume that male patients
are similar enough to have the same response to treatment. So are female
patients. But is that enough? Maybe being a diabetic is also important in
addition to being male or female. But maybe even that is not enough
either. Maybe age is also important. So you see that we have another problem in
our hands.

\newpage

# Slide 8

What makes two patients similar? And more specifically, what makes two patients
similiar for us to assume that their response to the treatments in question will
be the same? For any two patients we can always find many characteristics that
make them similar and many more that make them different. How do we proceed, in
a more standardized manner, to identify such characteristics and ultimately
answer our question: What is the predicted benefit for a specific patient if I
give them treatment A compared to treatment B? How much will treatment A reduce
a specific patient's likelihood of having a bad outcome, like acute myocardial
infarction from the example earlier?

And there are many different methods that have been suggested over the years by
other researchers that can be used to answer this question.

\newpage

# Slide 9

So, as the first aim of this dissertation, we decided to categorize methods
available in the literature for the prediction of benefit based on their
definition of patient similarity.

\newpage

# Slide 10

We identified two large groups of methods.

Risk-based methods define similarity based solely on risk factors. Going back to
the hypertension example, this would mean that these methods assume that
patients at the same risk for acute myocardial infarction are expected to
experience the same effect from a treatment targeted to their disease.

Treatment effect modeling methods define similarity on risk factors and effect
modifiers. We call effect modifiers certain patient characteristics that are
capable of altering how effective a treatment will be for a patient. So, it
looks that this group of methods may make a lot of sense to focus on since, they
not only require patients to be at the same risk for the outcome we are trying
to prevent but also require them to interact with treatment in the same
way. There is, however, an important problem. These characteristics that modify
treatment are not always known or they can be so many making very hard to for us
to put in a model.

Therefore, as the subtitle of this thesis says, we will focus on risk-based
methods.

\newpage

# Slide 11

And this brings us to the second aim of my thesis: Develop scalable risk-based
approaches to the assessment of treatment effect heterogeneity.

But, first, a short introduction is required. For the entirety of my PhD we were
very lucky to have access to data of millions of patients, mainly from the US
and Europe for our experiments. This data was not collected from any clinical
trials, but rather it was data that health insurance companies collect for their
customers, or data that hospitals collect for their patients. This means that
our data came from what we call the real world as opposed to data from clinical
trials, where the setting is very tightly controlled.

This is both a blessing, and a curse. It's a blessing because we can analyze
data of millions of people. However, it is also a curse, because randomization
that is the key feature for easily achieving patient similarity is now gone.

Since this is "real world data", it means that we get to see patients treated by
physicians that, hopefully, use some evidence to decide whether to give
treatment A or treatment B and don't rely on a coin flip.

\newpage

# Slide 12

This creates the problem that patients receiving different treatments tend to be
systematically different and now it is very hard for us to compare. But not
impossible. Not always, anyway. There are methods that we can use to make
patients receiving different treatments more similar and thus achieve a setup
closer to a clinical trial that used randomization.

\newpage

# Slide 13

However, there is another problem and that is the lack of interoperability
between observational databases. That is a more elegant way of saying that any
database of this kind, tends to use its own way of storing patient data, and
therefore if I want to use multiple of these databases, I will need to redesign
my analysis every time. Luckily, we avoided this problem by using a common data
model called OMOP. As a concept it's similar to the fact that here today many of
us speak different languages, however you can all understand what I am
saying. Hopefully. The common data model sits on top of all our databases and
acts as sort of translator. We only need to speak to it and it will take care of
the rest.

This is very important. Now I can use the same design and apply it in the
Netherlands, the US, S. Korea and so on. This allows my methods to become
scalable.
